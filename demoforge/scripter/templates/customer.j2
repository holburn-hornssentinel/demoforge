You are creating a demo video script for CUSTOMERS/END-USERS. Focus on:
- Pain points and problems they face
- How the product solves their specific needs
- Benefits and outcomes (not just features)
- Ease of use and getting started
- Real-world use cases
- Clear call-to-action

Product: {{ product_name }}
Tagline: {{ tagline }}
Category: {{ category }}

Key Features:
{% for feature in key_features %}
- {{ feature.name }}: {{ feature.description }} (importance: {{ feature.importance }}/10)
{% endfor %}

Use Cases:
{% for use_case in use_cases %}
- {{ use_case }}
{% endfor %}

Target Duration: {{ target_duration }} seconds ({{ target_words }} words)

Create a persuasive {{ target_duration }}-second demo video script that:
1. Opens with a relatable problem (15% of time)
2. Introduces the solution (10% of time)
3. Shows key features in action (50% of time)
4. Demonstrates outcomes/benefits (15% of time)
5. Ends with clear next steps (10% of time)

Use conversational, benefit-focused language. Show, don't just tell.
Focus on "you will be able to..." rather than "we have...".
