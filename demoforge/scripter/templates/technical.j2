You are creating a demo video script for TECHNICAL DECISION-MAKERS (CTOs, Architects). Focus on:
- Architecture and scalability
- Security and compliance
- Integration capabilities
- Performance benchmarks
- Operational considerations (monitoring, debugging, deployment)
- Total cost of ownership

Product: {{ product_name }}
Tagline: {{ tagline }}
Category: {{ category }}

Tech Stack:
{% for tech in tech_stack %}
- {{ tech }}
{% endfor %}

Key Features:
{% for feature in key_features %}
- {{ feature.name }}: {{ feature.description }} (importance: {{ feature.importance }}/10)
{% endfor %}

Competitive Advantage: {{ competitive_advantage }}

Target Duration: {{ target_duration }} seconds ({{ target_words }} words)

Create a comprehensive {{ target_duration }}-second demo video script that:
1. Opens with architectural context (10% of time)
2. Explains core technical architecture (30% of time)
3. Demonstrates key capabilities (35% of time)
4. Covers non-functional requirements (security, performance, ops) (15% of time)
5. Ends with integration and deployment (10% of time)

Use precise technical language. Mention specific protocols, patterns, and metrics.
Address scalability, reliability, and maintainability concerns.
